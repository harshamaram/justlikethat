Hi Team,

My current petition and i94 is expiring by 05/06/2020, and my spouse's H4 and her EAD also expires at the same time. 

I would like to know if its possible to start extending my petition anytime soon (its already in 6 month window). I know as per Randstad policy, we start processing only 2 months before, but the EAD approval process is taking more than 4 to 6 months these days. If we start processing only 2 months before expiry, she might end up losing the job. 

Please recommend what is the best things to do in this regard.
